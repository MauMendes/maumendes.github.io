After spending some time studying [**Uncrustify blog post**](https://maumendes.github.io/posts/uncrustify/) and customizing the `kr-indent.cfg` file for my own needs, I thoughtâ€”why not share these improvements with the project?

To my surprise (and joy), the changes were accepted! ðŸŽ‰  
This just shows that **anyone can contribute to open source** and make a difference, even with small changes.

Hereâ€™s my first proud open source contribution:  
ðŸ‘‰ [Pull Request #4474](https://github.com/uncrustify/uncrustify/pull/4474)

I didnâ€™t stop thereâ€”I decided to keep the momentum going and helped out a bit more with the projectâ€™s documentation. Specifically, I worked on synchronizing two related files:  
ðŸ‘‰ [Pull Request #4475](https://github.com/uncrustify/uncrustify/pull/4475)

I really encourage everyone to get involved in open source. Itâ€™s fun, rewarding, and a great way to learn and connect with others.

**Viel SpaÃŸ!** (Have fun, friends!)
