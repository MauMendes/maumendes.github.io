In 2025, I attended Embedded World for the first time, and it was an incredible experience! It was great to reconnect with old colleagues and meet fellow Brazilians working in companies around the world.  

Trade fairs like this are valuable for many reasons. The main benefit is getting to see the latest industry trends and innovations, but they also provide a great opportunity to catch up with colleagues and make new connections. I highly recommend attending in a small groupâ€”different people will have interests in different areas, and someone will likely ask a vendor a question you wouldnâ€™t have thought of yourself.  

## The Exhibition  

One of the most impressive aspects of the fair was seeing so many vendors in one place. Companies like **Infineon, Microchip, NXP, Nordic, ST, Texas Instruments**â€”and yes, even **Espressif**â€”were all showcasing their latest products. On the software side, **Altium** and **MATLAB** had some particularly interesting demos.  

## My Personal Highlights  

Here are a few things that stood out to me at Embedded World 2025:  

### 1) The Worldâ€™s Smallest Microcontroller â€“ Texas Instruments MSPM0C1104  

This tiny powerhouse is based on the **Cortex M0** architecture, and its compact size opens up exciting possibilities for ultra-miniature applications.

### 2) Nordicâ€™s Ultra-Low Power IoT Modem â€“ nRF91 SoC  

Nordic Semiconductor showcased their latest **low-power cellular IoT** solution, which could be a game-changer for battery-powered applications.

### 3) The Wednesday Party ðŸŽ‰  

After the fair wrapped up on **Wednesday (around 4 PM)**, people started gathering for drinks, and a DJ set the mood with some music. It was great to see engineers relaxing and socializingâ€”it added a fun and unexpected twist to the event!  

**Viel SpaÃŸ!** _(Have fun, friends!)_
