# About Me

Hello! I'm **Mauricio Mendes**, an Electrical Engineer with a passion for technology, embedded systems, and software development. I currently live and work in Marktoberdorf, Germany, and I'm always eager to explore new opportunities and challenges in my field.

## My Journey
I started my career as an Electrical Engineer, specializing in software development for industrial machinery, particularly tractors. My journey has led me through various projects, including firmware development, system integration, and IoT-related solutions.

Currently, I’m exploring different technology stacks and focusing on things like low-power hardware choices and various development tools such as RTI DDS and OpenWRT.

## My Skills
- **Programming Languages**: C/C++, C#, Python ...
- **Tools**: Git, Docker, Kubernetes, RTI DDS, OpenWRT
- **Embedded Systems**: STM32, NanoPi, LoRaWAN, and more
- **IoT Solutions**: Building telemetry and sensor networks

## What I Do
I specialize in developing embedded systems, focusing on efficiency and low power consumption. I’m particularly interested in the growing field of connected systems (LoRaWAN, IoT) and how they can improve industries like agriculture, automotive, and beyond.

In addition to my technical skills, I enjoy tackling complex problems and am always looking to stay up to date with the latest in embedded systems and software development, and of course. Have fun!

## Let's Connect!
Feel free to reach out to me through GitHub or LinkedIn. I’m always open to discussing exciting new projects, learning opportunities, or sharing insights about technology and innovation.
